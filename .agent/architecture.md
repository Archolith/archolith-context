# archolith-context — Architecture

## Overview

An OpenAI-compatible proxy that transparently replaces linear conversation replay
with graph-assembled context for AI coding agents. Any harness that supports a
base URL override (Reasonix, Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, etc.) works unchanged.

## Project Description

`archolith-context` is a transparent OpenAI-compatible proxy for coding agent sessions
that replaces append-only transcript replay with LLM-driven context curation. Instead
of resending stale conversation history, it extracts durable session facts and file
content into a local knowledge store, then uses a dedicated Context Manager LLM to
build the minimum viable context window for each turn. The goal is lower token spend,
better continuity in long coding sessions, and — critically — a coding agent that
never re-reads a file it already knows, never loses a decision it has already made,
and never degrades from context bloat.

## Archolith Ecosystem

archolith-context is one module in a broader end-to-end AI tooling platform.
Each module is a standalone Python library — installable independently, with
zero knowledge of its siblings.  archolith-context is the orchestration layer
that wires them together at the proxy boundary.

| Module | Role | Dependency model |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **archolith-rtk** | Token reduction — filter noise, shrink oversized tool results | Optional peer; fail-open lazy import |
| **archolith-memory** | Long-term memory — cross-session fact storage and retrieval | Optional peer; fail-open lazy import (planned) |
| **archolith-context** | Proxy — orchestrates session context, extraction, curation | Orchestrator; imports peers when available |

**Design constraint (applies to all modules):**
- Each module ships as `pip install archolith-<name>` with no mandatory dependencies on siblings
- archolith-context treats peers as optional: all peer integration paths are fail-open
- Peers have zero dependency on archolith-context and are usable standalone
- MCP servers (when they exist) are thin wrappers around the library — not the primary integration surface
- The proxy is the primary integration surface: it imports libraries directly, not via HTTP or tool calls

**archolith-memory integration shape (planned):**
- Read path: proxy queries `archolith_memory.recall(query)` before each upstream call and injects relevant long-term memories into context automatically — no agent tool call required
- Write path: proxy calls `archolith_memory.store(fact, confidence)` from the promotion pipeline for high-confidence session facts — no agent tool call required
- Explicit write: MCP server exposes `add_memory` / `add_todo` as thin wrappers for agent-initiated writes when the agent wants to tag something important
- The MCP server's recall tools (`recall_memories`, `build_context`) become optional/legacy once proxy-side injection is live

---

## Technical Thesis

The system is built around a simple claim: linear transcript replay is the wrong
data structure for long coding sessions.

- Standard agent clients treat context as an append-only log and pay the cost of
resending large amounts of stale history on every turn.
- This project treats context as a continuously curated working set: preserve the
local coherence tail, extract durable state off-path, invalidate superseded
facts, and rebuild the middle of the prompt from session state instead of raw
replay.
- Token savings is the measurable outcome, but the deeper architectural goal is
to make prompt compaction less necessary by keeping the session state curated
continuously rather than waiting for the transcript to overflow.
- The proxy shape matters: by enforcing this curation layer at the API boundary,
the system can improve existing harnesses without requiring each agent runtime
to adopt a custom memory SDK or internal framework.

## Data Flow

```
Harness → POST /v1/chat/completions → Proxy
│
├─ ON REQUEST:
│ 1. Parse incoming messages array
│ 2. Preserve: system prompt + last N messages (coherence tail)
│ 3. If CURATOR_ENABLED and turn >= cold_start_turns:
│    a. Run Context Manager LLM loop (≤4 tool calls, 6s budget)
│    b. LLM retrieves file sections, facts, decisions via 7 tools
│    c. Returns CuratorResult → assembled as system message
│    d. On timeout/failure: fall through to heuristic assembler
│ 4. Heuristic assembler (fallback or when curator disabled):
│    a. Query session graph: goal, active files, decisions, relevant facts
│    b. Score and budget facts to CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET tokens
│ 5. rewrite_messages(): merge graph context + coherence tail
│    a. RTK Layer 1: filter_tool_messages() strips noise from tool-role messages
│    b. RTK Layer 2: shrink_tool_call_args() collapses large Write/Edit args
│    c. RTK Layer 2: shrink_tail_tool_results() caps token footprint of tail tool msgs
│ 6. Forward curated payload to real upstream API
│
├─ ON RESPONSE:
│ 7. Stream response back to harness (unchanged)
│ 8. Async: extract facts from response + tool results
│    a. RTK Layer 1: filter_single_tool_result() denoises each tool result
│       before packing into the 4000-char extractor budget
│ 9. Store facts in session graph with temporal edges
│ 9b. Cache file content: pair tool_call_id → file path → content (SHA-256 dedup)
│     Update FileContent table; skip if content hash unchanged
│     Also cache Write/create_file tool_call args directly (no re-read needed)
│ 10. Invalidate superseded facts
│
└─ LIFECYCLE:
  - Session created on first request (keyed by conversation fingerprint)
  - Sessions expire after configurable TTL (default 24h)
  - Optional: promote high-confidence facts to long-term memory
```

## Component Breakdown

### Proxy Layer (`archolith_proxy/proxy/`)
- FastAPI app mimicking OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions`
- SSE streaming pass-through
- Session identification (fingerprint from system prompt + first user message)
- Request rewriting (linear → graph-assembled)
- Response capture (for post-hoc extraction)

### Context Assembler (`archolith_proxy/assembler/`)
- Queries session graph for relevant facts given current user intent
- Budgets output to configurable token limit (default ~15K)
- Always includes: session goal, active files, recent decisions
- Formats as synthetic assistant/system messages for the upstream model

### Curator LLM (`archolith_proxy/curator/`)

The primary assembly path when `CURATOR_ENABLED=true`. A tool-calling LLM that
builds the context block for each turn by actively querying the session's
knowledge store.

**Entry point:** `curate_context()` in `curator/__init__.py`
- Gated by: `CURATOR_ENABLED`, `FILE_CACHE_ENABLED`, cold-start turn count
- Model/URL/key resolved from `CURATOR_*` settings → fall back to extractor settings
- Hard latency cap: `asyncio.wait_for(loop, timeout=CURATOR_LATENCY_BUDGET_MS/1000)`
- Returns `AssembledContext` on success, `None` on timeout/failure (triggers fallback)

**Loop:** `_run_curator_native()` in `curator/loop.py`
- Up to `CURATOR_MAX_ITERATIONS` (default 4) tool-call iterations
- Stuck-loop detection: 4-wide error window, aborts on repeated identical calls
- Nous XML fallback (`_run_curator_nous()`) for models without native tool calling
- Exponential backoff with Retry-After header handling

**Result type:** `CuratorResult` in `curator/result.py`
```python
@dataclass
class CuratorResult:
    context_text: str       # formatted context block (system message content)
    curated_paths: set[str] # file paths the LLM selected
    tool_calls_used: int    # number of tool calls made
    estimated_tokens: int   # rough token estimate of context_text
```

**13 curator tools** (`curator/tools.py`):

| Tool | What it returns |
|------|----------------|
| `get_checkpoint` | Current session checkpoint (summary, next_step, confidence) |
| `get_open_issues` | Active issues (open blockers and errors) |
| `get_last_verification` | Most recent command run + pass/fail/partial status |
| `list_session_files` | Markdown table: path, lines, last-turn |
| `get_file` | Full content (≤200 lines) or 10-line preview + hint to use `get_file_lines` |
| `get_file_lines` | 1-indexed line slice with line numbers; clamps to EOF |
| `get_file_outline` | Symbol index (functions/classes with line numbers) for large files — use before `get_file_lines` |
| `search_facts` | Keyword substring match over active facts, up to 20 results |
| `search_facts_semantic` | Cosine similarity search over fact embeddings; falls back to substring when embeddings unavailable |
| `get_session_goal` | Session goal string |
| `get_recent_decisions` | Numbered list of decisions with turn numbers |
| `get_touched_files` | Path / status / turn table for all files touched in session |
| `select_relevant_turns` | Prune the middle-section turn inventory — mark which historical turns to retain |

**System prompt** (`curator/prompts.py`):
- Pre-loaded checkpoint in user prompt — skip `get_checkpoint` unless a refresh is needed
- For files >100 lines: call `get_file_outline` first, then `get_file_lines` for relevant range
- Use `search_facts` for keyword lookups; use `search_facts_semantic` when terminology may differ
- 3–6 tool calls per run; hard latency cap via `CURATOR_LATENCY_BUDGET_MS`
- Output format: `=== SESSION GOAL ===`, `=== CURRENT STATE ===`, `=== OPEN ISSUES ===`, `=== LAST VERIFICATION ===`, `=== RELEVANT CODE ===`, `=== KEY FACTS ===`, `=== DECISIONS ===`

### File Content Cache (LadybugDB `FileContent` table)

Populated during `_run_extraction()` via `_extract_file_reads()` + `_upsert_file_cache()`:
- `_extract_file_reads(messages)`: pairs tool results to their originating tool calls via
  `tool_call_id` — extracts `{path, content}` with no ordering inference
- `_upsert_file_cache(session_id, file_reads, turn)`: SHA-256 dedup (skip write if hash
  unchanged), max-file-bytes guard (`FILE_CACHE_MAX_FILE_BYTES`), upsert into `FileContent` table

**`FileContent` node schema:**
```
file_id (PK)           STRING  — "{session_id}:{path}"
session_id             STRING
path                   STRING
content                STRING  — full file text
sha256                 STRING  — hex digest for change detection
line_count             INT64   — precomputed for get_file_lines efficiency
last_updated_turn      INT64
created_at             TIMESTAMP
```

Cache methods on `LadybugBackend`: `upsert_file_content`, `get_file_content`,
`get_file_lines`, `list_cached_files`. Neo4j backend has stub implementations
(returns None/[]) — file cache is LadybugDB-only in MVP.

### Fact Extractor (`archolith_proxy/extractor/`)
- Calls cheap model (gpt-4.1-mini) to parse assistant responses + tool results
- Extracts: entities, relationships, decisions, state changes
- Produces structured facts with temporal metadata
- Runs async (off critical path, concurrent with user think time)

### Session Graph (`archolith_proxy/graph/`)
- Neo4j driver targeting `context_sessions` database (isolated from memory)
- Graphiti client for temporal entity/edge management
- Session lifecycle: create, query, invalidate, expire, promote
- Node types: File, Function, Decision, Error, Goal, ToolResult, State

### Config (`archolith_proxy/config.py`)
- Upstream API URL and credentials (validated: must be http/https)
- Neo4j connection (separate from long-term memory)
- Extraction model selection
- Token budgets, TTL, coherence tail size
- Cold start turns gate (user-turn count is authoritative; token threshold is retained as a compatibility setting)
- Retry settings: upstream and Neo4j (max retries, backoff base seconds)
- Promotion settings (if wired to long-term memory)
- Memory engine config (JSON array of engine definitions)
- Promotion policy defaults (min confidence, dry-run mode)
- Synthetic tools: enabled, circuit breaker thresholds, file recall limits
- Session token budget: max input tokens per session, budget action (passthrough/reject)
- Settings singleton caching (get_settings / reset_settings)

### Memory Engine & Promotion (`archolith_proxy/memory/`)
- **Registry** (`registry.py`): Config-driven engine registration, lazy adapter instantiation, priority-based default resolution
- **Canonical models** (`models.py`): `PromotionRecord`, `PromotionResult`, `EngineCapabilities`, `MemoryEngineConfig`
- **Adapter base** (`adapters/base.py`): Abstract contract — validate_config, capabilities, healthcheck, promote_fact, optional batch/dedupe/CRUD
- **Concrete adapters** (`adapters/`): cth_mcp_memory, mem0, zep, generic_http
- **Promotion service** (`promotion.py`): Policy layer (confidence threshold, fact type allowlist, multi-turn survival), dedupe, dry-run, audit trail

### Synthetic Session-Summary Tools (`archolith_proxy/proxy/synthetic_tools.py`)

Agent-initiated tools that the proxy injects into every request when a session is active
and `SYNTHETIC_TOOLS_ENABLED=true`. The model can call these to get structured summaries
of session work and files accessed without the harness needing to support custom tools.

**Three synthetic tools:**

| Tool | What it returns |
|------|----------------|
| `recall_session_work` | Structured summary of all work done this session |
| `recall_files_read` | List of files accessed, to skip redundant re-reads |
| `recall_file` | Content of a specific file (line-limited, from proxy cache) |

**How it works:**
1. `inject_synthetic_tools(body)` — add tool definitions before forwarding upstream
2. Upstream responds with tool_calls containing a synthetic name
3. `handle_non_streaming_synthetic()` detects the call, generates the result, re-sends
4. `strip_synthetic_tools` / `strip_synthetic_from_response` clean up so client never sees internal tooling
5. On re-send failure: `_fallback_strip_synthetic()` strips synthetic calls and normalizes `finish_reason`

**Non-streaming path only** (same limitation as `__archolith_recall`).
When the original client requested streaming, the forced-non-streaming path converts
the result to SSE via `_wrap_response_as_sse()`.

**Critical bug fixed (2026-05-25):** `_wrap_response_as_sse()` previously only emitted
`role`, `content`, and `finish_reason` deltas — never `tool_calls`. When the model
made mixed calls (synthetic + real), OpenCode received `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`
but no tool call data, causing an infinite retry loop. Fixed by emitting tool_calls as
separate name+argument deltas with proper `index` keys (matching the OpenAI streaming spec).

### Circuit Breaker (`archolith_proxy/proxy/circuit_breaker.py`)

Per-session circuit breaker that prevents runaway synthetic tool re-injection loops.
State is in-memory only (resets on proxy restart).

**Thresholds (configurable via env):**
- `SYNTHETIC_CIRCUIT_MAX_CONSECUTIVE` (default 3): consecutive failures before opening circuit
- `SYNTHETIC_CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN_S` (default 300): seconds to keep circuit open
- `SYNTHETIC_CIRCUIT_MAX_TOTAL` (default 10): total failures before session-lifetime hard-disable

**Flow:**
1. Before calling `inject_synthetic_tools()`, `chat.py` checks `is_synthetic_allowed(session_id)`
2. If circuit is open → skip injection, increment `synthetic_injections_skipped` metric
3. On success → `record_synthetic_success()` resets consecutive counter
4. On failure (exception or fallback) → `record_synthetic_failure()` increments counters
5. After 3 consecutive → circuit opens for 5 min; after 10 total → hard-disable for session lifetime

**Also tracks per-session token budget:** `add_session_tokens()` / `is_session_over_budget()`
for the `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS_PER_SESSION` hard cap.

## Isolation from Long-term Memory

| | Long-term memory (archolith-memory) | Session context (this project) |
|--|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Storage backend | Library-defined (PostgreSQL, SQLite, or custom adapter) | LadybugDB (default, embedded) or Neo4j |
| Isolation | Separate store entirely — no shared tables or labels | Session-scoped; all nodes carry `session_id` |
| Lifecycle | Persistent, cross-session, survives proxy restarts | Ephemeral, TTL per session (default 24h) |
| Write path | Proxy promotion pipeline (high-confidence facts) + agent via MCP `add_memory` | Proxy extracts automatically every turn |
| Read path | Proxy injects via `archolith_memory.recall()` (planned); MCP `recall_memories` / `build_context` today | Proxy assembler (internal, no agent tool call needed) |

When running without archolith-memory, long-term memory is handled by whatever the agent's MCP server provides (`cth.mcp.memory` or equivalent). The proxy promotion pipeline writes to whichever memory backend is configured via `MEMORY_ENGINES_JSON`.

**Neo4j isolation note (when used as session backend):** Session nodes carry the `:ContextSession` label; any long-term memory nodes in the same Neo4j instance use `:Memory`. All queries are label-scoped. Session data is bulk-droppable: `MATCH (n:ContextSession) DETACH DELETE n`.

## Observability (Phase 4)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /health` | Health check: Neo4j status, upstream status, version, uptime |
| `GET /metrics` | Process-level counters: total_requests, assembly_modes, extraction_successes/empties/failures, upstream_errors, neo4j_errors, active_sessions, token_savings_estimated, total_input_tokens_seen, trace_records, trace_sessions, uptime, curator_calls, curator_timeouts, curator_fallbacks, synthetic_tool_successes, synthetic_tool_failures, synthetic_circuit_opens, synthetic_circuit_hard_disables, synthetic_injections_skipped, synthetic_circuit_states (per-session) |
| `GET /sessions` | List active sessions (admin, 503 if Neo4j down) |
| `GET /sessions/{id}` | Session stats (admin, 404 if not found, 503 if Neo4j down) |
| `GET /trace/sessions` | List all sessions with trace records |
| `GET /trace/sessions/{id}` | Session trace summary + turns (limit/offset pagination) |
| `GET /trace/turns/{turn_id}` | Single turn trace by turn_id |
| `GET /trace/graph/{sid}/facts` | Session facts with filters: fact_type, min_confidence, from_turn, to_turn, include_invalidated |
| `GET /trace/graph/{sid}/invalidations` | Supersession/invalidation chains for a session |
| `GET /trace/graph/{sid}/files` | Files touched by a session (via TOUCHES edges) |
| `GET /trace/graph/{sid}/decisions` | Decisions recorded for a session |
| `GET /trace/graph/{sid}/recall` | Recall events from trace records |
| `POST /trace/qa/extract` | Extraction QA workbench — run extraction without full proxy replay; dedup and invalidation checks now route through the active backend (`ladybug` or `neo4j`) |
| `GET /memory-engines` | List configured memory engines with health status |
| `GET /memory-engines/{id}` | Single engine details, health, and capabilities |
| `GET /promotions` | Promotion history and stats |
| `POST /promotions/retry/{id}` | Retry a failed promotion |
| `GET /dashboard/` | Web dashboard (single-page HTML, zero build step) |
| `GET /ws/stream` | WebSocket live event stream |

Metrics are in-memory (`_metrics` dict surfaced via `archolith_proxy/metrics.py`), reset on process restart. Prometheus-compatible OpenMetrics format is a future goal.

`assembly_modes` tracks: `graph`, `fallback`, `cold_start`, `passthrough`, `curator`.

## Resilience (Phase 4)

### Upstream Retry
`upstream_request_with_retry()` in `archolith_proxy/proxy/upstream.py`:
- Exponential backoff on 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 + `TimeoutException` + `ConnectError`
- Configurable: `UPSTREAM_MAX_RETRIES` (default 3), `UPSTREAM_RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE_S` (default 0.5s)

### Neo4j Startup Retry
`_init_neo4j_with_retry()` in `archolith_proxy/main.py`:
- Exponential backoff on connection failure at startup
- Configurable: `NEO4J_MAX_RETRIES` (default 3), `NEO4J_RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE_S` (default 1.0s)
- If all retries fail, proxy starts without graph features (passthrough mode)

### Graceful Degradation
- Assembler wraps each graph query in try/except → returns None on failure
- Chat handler tracks `assembly_mode`: `cold_start` (below threshold), `graph` (success), `curator` (curator-assembled), `fallback` (graph failed, used passthrough), `passthrough` (Neo4j not configured)
- Extraction failures logged + counted, never block the response
- Proxy returns 503 if lifespan didn't initialize `http_client`

### Config Validation
- `field_validator` on `upstream_base_url` (must be http/https), `proxy_port` (1–65535)
- Warning log on empty `upstream_api_key`
- `check_required_for_graph()` → list of missing vars for graph features
- `check_required_for_proxy()` → list of missing vars for basic proxy
- Settings singleton via `get_settings()` + `reset_settings()` for tests

## Docker Deployment (Phase 4)

- `Dockerfile`: python:3.12-slim + uv, healthcheck on `/health`, uvicorn CMD
- `docker-compose.yml`: proxy + neo4j:5-community with APOC plugin, healthchecks, volumes, dependency ordering
- Override file: `docker-compose.override.yml` (gitignored)

## Token Reduction — archolith-rtk Integration

Token reduction is handled by `archolith-rtk`, a standalone Python library that lives
in a sibling project (`projects/archolith/archolith-rtk`).  It is the **preferred and
canonical** token reduction toolkit for this workspace.  archolith-context treats it as
a first-class peer: when installed, it is used deeply at every pipeline point where
token reduction matters; when absent, all RTK paths are fail-open and the proxy operates
without RTK passes.

### Layers

| Layer | Module | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Layer 1 — Output Filtering | `archolith_rtk.filter_output` | Strips noise/boilerplate from tool results: git diffs, test output, build logs, lint, directory trees, JSON payloads, search results. 13 named categories + cross-turn deduplication via `DedupeTracker`. ANSI stripping is always applied. Fail-open: exceptions return ANSI-stripped input unchanged. |
| Layer 2 — Shrink | `archolith_rtk.shrink` | Deterministic token budgeting: `shrink_oversized_tool_call_args_by_tokens` collapses large string values in assistant tool_call JSON (Write/Edit file content); `shrink_oversized_tool_results_by_tokens` truncates tool-role messages over a per-message token cap. |

### Adapter (`archolith_proxy/rtk.py`)

A thin adapter that lazy-loads archolith-rtk with independent per-function sentinels
(sentinel = `False` → unresolved, `None` → unavailable, callable → loaded).  Each
wrapper is **fail-open**: if archolith-rtk is not installed, `ImportError` sets the
sentinel to `None` and the wrapper returns its input unchanged.

**Public API exposed by the adapter:**

| Function | RTK call | Where used |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `filter_tool_messages(messages, enabled)` | Layer 1 `filter_output` per tool-role message | `filter_request_body()` — applied to every outbound request |
| `filter_single_tool_result(content, tool_name)` | Layer 1 `filter_output` on one string | `_collect_recent_tool_results()` in `chat.py` — denoises tool output before extractor LLM sees it |
| `shrink_tool_call_args(messages, max_tokens, enabled)` | Layer 2 `shrink_oversized_tool_call_args_by_tokens` | `filter_request_body()` — collapses large Write/Edit args in assistant history |
| `shrink_tail_tool_results(messages, max_tokens_per_result)` | Layer 2 `shrink_oversized_tool_results_by_tokens` | `rewrite_messages()` in `rewrite.py` — caps each tool-role message in the coherence tail |

### Integration Points

```
REQUEST PATH:
  filter_request_body()
    └── filter_tool_messages()          ← Layer 1: strip noise from tool-role history
    └── shrink_tool_call_args()         ← Layer 2: collapse Write/Edit file content args

EXTRACTION (async, off critical path):
  _collect_recent_tool_results()
    └── filter_single_tool_result()     ← Layer 1: denoise before extractor LLM budget

CONTEXT ASSEMBLY:
  rewrite_messages() — tail append
    └── shrink_tail_tool_results()      ← Layer 2: cap token footprint of each tail tool msg
```

### Relationship Between Projects

archolith-rtk is the first concrete module in the [Archolith Ecosystem](#archolith-ecosystem) —
the same optional-peer pattern applies to archolith-memory (planned) and any future modules.

archolith-rtk is **not a dependency** of archolith-context in the `pyproject.toml` sense — it is an optional peer.  This preserves the ability to run archolith-context standalone without the RTK library installed.  When both are present in the same virtualenv, RTK is used automatically with no configuration required.

```bash
uv pip install -e ../archolith-rtk  # from inside archolith-context
```

archolith-rtk has zero dependency on archolith-context and can be used independently as a standalone token-reduction library in any Python project.

## External Dependencies

| Service | Purpose | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| LadybugDB | Session graph + file cache (default backend — embedded, zero infra) | Default — no infra needed |
| Neo4j | Session graph alternative for production deployments | Optional — only when `GRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j` |
| OpenAI API (gpt-4.1-mini) | Fact extraction + curator LLM | Optional — extraction skipped on failure |
| OpenAI API (embeddings) | Semantic similarity for `search_facts_semantic` | Optional — falls back to substring search |
| Upstream LLM API | Target for proxied requests | **Yes — required** |
| archolith-rtk | Token reduction (Layer 1 + Layer 2) | Optional peer (fail-open) |
| archolith-memory | Long-term cross-session memory | Optional peer (planned — fail-open) |
| Memory backend API (e.g. cth.mcp.memory) | Promotion target for durable facts | Optional — only when `PROMOTION_ENABLED=true` |

## Port Assignment
